        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Hi, Nice to meet you, I'm Tom </h3>
        <p>
          In a past life I was a Pub Manager, pleasing the people of London and
          then Teesside with cold pints and warm chips.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always had an ongoing interest in technology, and as I
          progressively wanted a career that would my creative side, I turned to
          Software Development, and haven't look back.
        </p>
        <p>
          After teaching myself the fundamentals of JavaScript, I took the
          plunge and started the Northcoders Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h3>On a personal note..</h3>
        <p>
          I live in York with my partner, play Golf (when the weather permits),
          Run (the same logic as golfing) and I am an optimistic Middlesbrough
          Football Club fan.
        </p>
